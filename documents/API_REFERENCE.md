# API Reference — `/api/v1`

Base URL (dev): `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`  
Proxied from the UI: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1` (Next rewrite) or Caddy `:8080`.

All JSON endpoints except auth login/register/forgot/verify/reset and `/health*` require JWT:

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
Cookie: access_token=<accessToken>
```

Successful login also sets httpOnly cookies `access_token` (8h) and `refresh_token` (7d).

OTP codes are returned in the forgot-password body **only when `NODE_ENV` is not `production`**.
